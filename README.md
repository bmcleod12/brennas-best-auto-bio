# Brenna McLeod's Brilliant Autobiography
https://bmcleod12.github.io/brennas-best-auto-bio/


## Description
This Brilliant Autobiography started as a homework assignment to build an About Me page and will likely be added to in time. It leverages Bootstrap and Bootstrap alone! to do some cool responsive things like resize images and present a hamburger menu in the navigation bar when the screen size is changed.

## Installation

Project files includes:
* HTML files that leverage the Bootstrap libraries
* An assets folder with images used in the site
No real special steps were needed for implementation aside from referencing Bootstrap, Popper, and JS

## Usage 

Open the webpage to poke around: https://bmcleod12.github.io/brennas-best-auto-bio/

The About page features some paragraphs about me with light sarcasm sprinkled throughout. It may become more serious when I have more to say about coding and what I want to pursue.

The Portfolio page features some works of art/crafts, and my one non-github project to this point.

The Contact page features forms that (don't) enable you to send an email to me. 

## Tests and Known Issues

Test 1:
With the page open, click each link in the navigation bar at the top left of the screen and confirm the site switches to the appropriate page. Confirm the page clicked in the menu remains lit up (active).

Test 2:
Open the page in different browsers to confirm each element of the page renders as expected.

Test 3:
Change the screen size and confirm the page elements respond to the viewport size, including images.

Known Issue:
When the page size is just right for the Monkey Scratch game text to wrap, it doesn't wrap with the indention that the others have. Possibly linked to it being a link! but remains an unsolved issue.

## Future Enhancements
1. Implement image enlargement (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/modal/)
2. Update the Submit button on the Contact page to be functional
3. Swap placeholder portfolio elements with real code examples
