# Portfolio
https://bmcleod12.github.io/mcleod-portfolio


## Description
This portfolio showcases my skills learned and projects created during the KU Coding Bootcamp.

## Installation
Project files includes:
* HTML files that leverage the Bootstrap and TailwindCSS libraries
* An assets folder with images used in the site
No real special steps were needed for implementation aside from referencing Bootstrap, Popper, and JS

## Usage 
Open the webpage to poke around: https://bmcleod12.github.io/mcleod-portfolio

The Home page displays a cover photo with a link to the About page.

## Tests
Test 1:
With the page open, click each link in the navigation bar at the top left of the screen and confirm the site switches to the appropriate page. Confirm the page clicked in the menu remains lit up (active).

Test 2:
Open the page in different browsers to confirm each element of the page renders as expected.

Test 3:
Change the screen size and confirm the page elements respond to the viewport size, including images.

## Future Enhancements
1. Update the Submit button on the Contact page to be functional
2. Add to the Portfolio page with more and complex projects
